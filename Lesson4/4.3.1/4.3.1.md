# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4.3.1 - JavaScript - For Loops Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**For Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify for loops in JavaScript.

We will create some for loops which will farm the area of the activity zone.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer drag out ``||PLAYER: run code on chat command jump ||`` block and drop it onto the code editor surface.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 4 
Change the text jump to farm to change the event handler to respond to the command farm.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 5
Firstly, lets get our agent to walk across the blocks before farming them.

From the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: for||`` block of code on line 2 to create a for loop.

Notice the default loop control variables name is i and its initial value is 0 and the loop will run while i is less than 5.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
    	
    }   
})
```

## Step 6 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 2 by changing the 5 to a 2 in the i < 5 part of the for loop.

This will cause the loop to enumerate twice and we will use it to run the same code on the 2 lines of grass blocks.

We will write some code for the agent to move 6 blocks next.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 7 
From the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: for||`` block of code on line 3 (inside the existing for loop).
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

        }    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 8 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 6 by changing the 5 to a 6 in the i < 5 part of the for loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {

        }    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 9 
From the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place a ``||AGENT: agent move direction by 1||`` block on line 4 inside the 2 loops.

This will cause the agent to move forward by one every time the loop enumerates.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }    	
    }   
})
```
##Step 10
Once the agent reaches the end of one of the lines of activity zone we need him to turn and move onto the adjacent set of grass blocks.

Place the cursor at the end of the code on line 5 (after the }) and press return to create a new line.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 

    }   
})
```
##Step 11
On this new blank line place an ``||AGENT: agent turn(TurnDirection.Left)||`` block from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer.

This will move our agent forward one block and turn him 90 degrees. 

We want to turn him 180 degrees so he can move back down the line of blocks so after the previous line of code added create 2 empty lines and add another ``||AGENT: agent move direction by 1||`` block and ``||AGENT: agent turn(TurnDirection.Left)||`` block.
one.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)    
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)  	
    }   
})
```


## Step 13
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 14 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Position yourself on top of the red wool block and run the command farm in the chat window.

![alt text](https://advancedjsv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.3.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Test")

3. Your agent should appear, take 6 steps forward until the end of the activity zone turn around and repeat the process on the way back.

## Step 15
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 16 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto Activity 2.
