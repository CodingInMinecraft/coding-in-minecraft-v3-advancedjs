# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4.2 - JavaScript - While loops in JavaScript

## Step 1 @unplugged
**While loops in JavaScript**

While loops will repeat a series of code statements whilst a boolean condition is true.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**While loops in JavaScript**

The While loop is made up of 2 lines of code with all the lines of code you want to repeat in the loop contained between them.

This example shows the while loop in its basic form with no lines of code within it.

The first line (line 2) of the while loop (while (true) {) contains the boolean condition to check to see of the loop should run again. By default this condition is set to the boolean value of true therefore the loop will run over and over again forever!

You will always change this to a boolean condition of your choice to control the loop.

Line 4 contains a closing curly bracket ( } ) which in JavaScript indicates the end of a block of code.

In this example we have added three lines of code into the loop along with some other code outside the loop.

On line 1 we have created a variable loopControl which will be used as part of our loop control.

Lines 2 and 3 position our agent 2 blocks away from us.

The while loop begins on line 5 and has the boolean expression loopControl < 5 as the boolean condition to control the loop.

The first time the loop runs the value of loopControl is 0 therefore the boolean condition evaluates to true as 0 is less than 5.

The 3 lines of code within the loop will run - the first 2 simply move the agent and have the agent place a block. The final line of code within the loop (line 8 - loopControl +=1) is very important as this updates the loopControl variable (increasing its value by 1) from within the loop - if we forget to do this the loop could run forever!

The loop runs a total of 5 times - when the value of loopControl is 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Once the value of loopControl reaches 5 the boolean condition to control the loop evaluates to false therefore the loop does not run when the value of loopControl is 5.
