# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6.1 - JavaScript - Syntax Errors

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**JavaScript Syntax Errors**

Syntax errors occur when you do not follow the rules of the language.

Syntax errors in JavaScript stop your program from running.

In the MakeCode JavaScript editor syntax errors are usually found automatically and highlighted by being underlined in a red wavy line.

The 2 most common causes of syntax errors in JavaScript are:

- Accidentally deleting a character from a JavaScript statement resulting in the word being mis-spelled.

- Forgetting to close a set of brackets.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**MakeCode JavaScript editor & syntax errors**

In this example the editor is highlighting a syntax error on line 2.

There is a syntax error somewhere on the line:

blocks.oBlockPlaced(Block.Grass, function () {

The red wavy line is usually where the syntax error is. (But not always!)

On this occasion there is an error in the word oBlockPlaced - this should be o**n**BlockPlaced. (Note the missing n.)

## Step 3 @unplugged
**MakeCode JavaScript editor & syntax errors**

If you hover the mouse over the error a pop up window will appear suggesting what the error is and how to fix it.

Note: sometimes this message may not be as helpful!

## Step 4 @unplugged
**MakeCode JavaScript editor & syntax errors**

If we fix the error by replacing the missing n the red wavy line should disappear.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Missing brackets**

In this example the editor is highlighting a syntax error on line 4.

![alt text](https://advancedjsv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.1/images/4.jpg?raw=true "error")

There is a syntax error somewhere on the line:

if (noOfBlocks % 5 == 0 {

The red wavy line is usually where the syntax error is. (But not always!)

On this occasion we have forgotten to close the brackets around the condition being evaluated for the if statement. If we place a closing bracket between the 0 and the opening curly bracket ( { ) this should fix the error.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Missing brackets**

Again once the error is resolved the red line disappears.

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Missing brackets**

Another common issue is that we accidentally delete (or forget to put in) closing curly brackets at the end of a section of code.

In this example notice there is a red underline on line 7.

Usually when there is a syntax error with brackets the red wavy line will appear just after where the missing bracket is.

The issue with this code is there is a missing closing curly bracket ( } )  to indicate the end of the blocks of code to run in the if statement.

## Step 8 @unplugged
**Missing brackets**

To resolve the error place a closing curly bracket ( } ) on line 6.

## Step 9 @unplugged
**Case sensitivity**

JavaScript is a case sensitive language.

That means that we need to be careful which letters are in lower case and which are in upper case.

In this example notice the word Player on line 5 is underlined.

## Step 10 @unplugged
**Case sensitivity**

If you hover the mouse over the underlined word it will give you a suggestion of how to resolve the error.

## Step 11 @unplugged
**Case sensitivity**

Change the p in player from upper to lower case to fix the syntax error.

## Step 12 @unplugged
**Reserved words**

In the JavaScript languages there are various (approx 60)  words which are part of the JavaScript language.

Such as:
- function
- let
- if
- while
- for

If we try to call a variable or function one of these keywords we will create a syntax error.

In this example we have called a variable function - notice it appears as a syntax error.

## Step 13 @unplugged
**Reserved words**

Change the variable name to something which is not a JavaScript keyword to resolve the error.
