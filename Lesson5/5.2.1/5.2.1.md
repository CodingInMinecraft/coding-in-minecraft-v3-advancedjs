# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 5.2.1 - JavaScript - Comparison Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Comparison Operators Activity**

In this activity we will use comparison operators to enhance the functionality of **IF THEN** statements.

We will create a program which will track the number of a chosen type of block placed and every time we lay 5 blocks we will tell the player the total amount of blocks laid.

In this program we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed which we will update when we lay or destroy a block of our chosen type. When this variable reaches a value which is divisible by 5 we will tell the player the total number of blocks currently placed.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
Enter the following text on line 1.
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
```
This will create a variable named noOfBlocks for us and set it to a starting value of 0.

We will use this variable to keep count of the number of blocks placed.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
```

## Step 4 
We want to give our player some blocks. We can use code to do this.  From the ``||MOBS: MOBS||`` drawer place an ``||MOBS: give target block or item block amount 1||`` code on line 2.
Change the player to say LOCAL_PLAYER, change the block to be BAMBOO_PLANKS, and change the number to 64. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
```


## Step 5 
From the ``||BLOCKS: BLOCKS||`` drawer place an ``||BLOCKS: run code on block placed||`` block on line 2.

This is an event handler which will run some code in response to placing a certain type of block. Grass will be the default block, so you need to change it to BAMBOO_PLANKS.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    
})
```
## Step 6
From the ``||VARIABLES: VARIABLES||`` drawer place a ``||VARIABLES: change||``  block on the next line to add the below JavaScript code:
```javascript
item += 1
```
This line of code increases the value of a variable by 1.

Change the variable we want to change by changing the text item to noOfBlocks.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    noOfBlocks += 1
})
```

## Step 7
Position your cursor at the end of line after noOfBlocks += 1 and insert a new line by pressing the enter key on the keyboard.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    noOfBlocks += 1

})
```
## Step 8
From the ``||LOGIC: LOGIC||`` drawer place an ``||LOGIC: if||`` block.

We will use this if statement to check if the number of blocks placed is a multiple of 5 and if so run some code.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    noOfBlocks += 1
    if (true) {

    }
})
```
## Step 9
The condition we want to evaluate in the if statement is if the number of blocks placed is a multiple of 5. 
We can do this by checking the remainder when we divide the noOfBlocks variable by 5 and if this remainder is 0 the noOfBlocks variable is a multiple of 5 as there is no remainder when divided by 5.

Replace the default true condition in the if statement with the following:
```javascript
noOfBlocks % 5 == 0
```
The % mathematical operator in JavaScript is the remainder of a division operation.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    noOfBlocks += 1
    if (noOfBlocks % 5 == 0) {

    }
})
```
## Step 10
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: say(":)")||``  block inside the if statement and change the text to "Number of blocks placed: "
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    noOfBlocks += 1
    if (noOfBlocks % 5 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed:")
    }
})
```
## Step 11
Position the cursor between the closing quote for "Number of blocks placed: " and the closing bracket of the say function and add the code
```javascript
+ noOfBlocks 
 ```
(careful to place this outside the quotes and before the closing bracket).

This allows us to join variables together in JavaScript so the say command will tell us the number of blocks placed.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let noOfBlocks = 0
mobs.give(mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),BAMBOO_PLANKS,64)
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BAMBOO_PLANKS, function () {
    noOfBlocks += 1
    if (noOfBlocks % 5 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed:" + noOfBlocks)
    }
})
```
## Step 12
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 13 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will notice that you get bamboo planks added into your hot bar. Select that spot. 


3. Place some bamboo plank blocks in the activity zone and notice that after every 5th block placed you will be told the number of blocks you have placed.

## Step 14
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 15 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non-Player Character.
