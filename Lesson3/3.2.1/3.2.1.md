# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3.2.1 - JavaScript - Modifying JavaScript code - Activity

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Changing the value of parameters in JavaScript - Activity**

We have already started to see how JavaScript code compares to block-based coding.

Previously we have looked at how JavaScript code compares to block-based coding but we haven't changed any of the JavaScript. 

We will now start to make changes to JavaScript to and see how this affects our Minecraft world.



## Step 2 @unplugged
We will create a sample program with some simple blocks as detailed below to learn more.

The below sample program in JavaScript is the equivalent of the below in MakeCode blocks

**JavaScript**
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "JavaScript")


**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 3
The code has been entered into the JavaScript editor for you below.

Notice that the 5 lines of code inside the event handler all call on functions of the player or agent and 4 of these take parameters (the only one not taking a parameter being the agent.teleportToPlayer()).

```template
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 4
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

You should have noticed that a message saying hi appears, your agent appears and turns right and moves one block forward and you then teleport to 10 blocks above your current position.

![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/3.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 7
Change the parameter being passed to the player.say function to "Hello player!" (note: keep the double quotes as this is a string variable).

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 8
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

Notice that a chat message reflecting the change you made in JavaScript is now displayed (Hello Player!).

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 10
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 11
On line 4 delete the word RIGHT_TURN from the agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN).

Replace it with LEFT_TURN.

These are the 2 directions the Agent can turn (Left and Right).

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```
## Step 12
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 13 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

Notice this time your agent will turn left rather than right.

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 14
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 15
Take a look at line 5

```javascript
agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
```

This line of JavaScript is the code which will move the agent in a certain direction by a number of blocks. 

The move method takes 2 parameters - the first one being the direction to move and the second one the number of blocks to move.

## Step 16
Firstly lets look at the first parameter the

```javascript
FORWARD
```

This is one of 6 directions the agent can move in - FORWARD, BACK, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP.

Delete the word FORWARD and enter the text RIGHT.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```
## Step 17
The second parameter (the one after the comma) is how many blocks to move and is a number type.

Change this number to 5 to move the agent 5 blocks to the right.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 5)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```
## Step 18
Next lets test the code.

## Step 19 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

You should have noticed that the Agent now moves 5 blocks to the right.

![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/10.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 20
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 21
The final line of code teleports the player to a position defined by a set of relative coordinates.

The teleport function of the player takes a position variable to tell it where to teleport the player to.

This coordinate is created using the pos function which takes 3 parameters - the X, Y and Z coordinates.

## Step 22
Change the coordinates to be the relative coordinates of 1 20 -1 by changing the 3 number parameters in the pos function to 1, 20, -1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
    agent.move(SixDirection.Right, 5)
    player.teleport(pos(1, 20, -1))
})
```
## Step 23
Next lets test the code.
