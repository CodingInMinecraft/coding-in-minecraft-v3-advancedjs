# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3.2.1 - JavaScript - Modifying JavaScript code - Activity

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Changing the value of parameters in JavaScript - Activity**

We have already started to see how JavaScript code compares to block-based coding.

Previously we have looked at how JavaScript code compares to block-based coding but we haven't changed any of the JavaScript. 

We will now start to make changes to JavaScript to and see how this affects our Minecraft world.



## Step 2 @unplugged
We will create a sample program with some simple blocks as detailed below to learn more.

The below sample program in JavaScript is the equivalent of the below in MakeCode blocks

**JavaScript**
```typescript 
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```
The code appears in the editor with line numbers as below:

## Step 3
The code has been entered into the JavaScript editor for you below.

Notice that the 4 lines of code inside the event handler all call on functions of the player or agent and all of these take parameters.

```template
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```


## Step 4
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

You should have noticed that a message saying hi appears, your agent appears and turns right and moves one block forward and you then teleport to 10 blocks above your current position.

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected, press C to come back to into MakeCode and then click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 7
Change the parameter being passed to the player.say function to "Hello player!" (note: keep the double quotes as this is a string variable).

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 8
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

Notice that a chat message reflecting the change you made in JavaScript is now displayed (Hello Player!).

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 10
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected use your Agent Device to do the Activity 1. 

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
