## Step 1 @unplugged

Block-based coding environments such as MakeCode are great for learning about coding. However, none of the apps we use on a daily basis have been created using a block-based coding environment as they have their limitations.

MakeCode provides us with the opportunity to move from a block-based coding environment to a text-based coding environment using JavaScript.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Differences between block-based and text-based coding languages**

Block-based coding languages are those that allow you to drag, drop and connect blocks together to form a program rather than write lines of code which you have to do with a text-based language.

Below is an example of the same program created using Block-Based code (MakeCode) and Text-Based code (JavaScript).

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Differences between block-based and text-based coding languages**

Block-based languages may be easier to use and easier to read for those starting to learn coding but they lack the complex functionality to create real-world programs.
