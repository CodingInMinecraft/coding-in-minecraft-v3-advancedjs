# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 - JavaScript - Comparing MakeCode to JavaScript - Activity

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1 @unplugged
**Comparing blocks to text - Activity**

In this activity we will explore the JavaScript interface in Code Builder and compare various MakeCode blocks to JavaScript code.

**Read through the whole tutorial and then try to perform the actions.**

You can download a copy of this activity by returning to the game and clicking the Download Activity button on the Non-Player Character.

## Step 2 @unplugged
In the NPC, click on the Blank Page button.

## Step 3 @unplugged
Click on the New Project icon to create a new MakeCode project.

When prompted set the project name to Lesson 3 Activity 1.

## Step 4 @unplugged
The default block-based coding editor with the default on chat command "run" block and on start block will appear.
 
Change the event handler (on chat command) to respond to the command sayHello by changing the text run to sayHello.

## Step 5 @unplugged
Click on the convert code to JavaScript button to display the code in JavaScript.

## Step 6 @unplugged

Notice there are 2 lines of code with an empty line between.

The first line of code starts with player.onChat - this is specifying that we want some code to run when a chat command is issued.

Remember the blue on chat command came from the player drawer - notice that its also colored blue in JavaScript.

Inside the brackets is where we can specify the chat command we want to respond to and the actions we want to perform when that chat command is used. These are known as parameters.

The first parameter "sayHello" is the chat command we want to respond to. (Note - the chat command will only take 1 word. If more than 1 word is needed, use Camel Case to differentiate between the words. Camel Case is when you do not capitalize the first word but capitalize all other words, such as buildWall or sayHello.)

The second command is code we want to run when that command is issued and will contain a list of other commands when we build up what we want to happen when sayHello is issued.

## Step 7 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the convert code to Blocks button. 

Add a ``||player: say ":)" ||`` block from the ``||player: Player ||`` drawer into the event handler.

## Step 8 @unplugged
Change back to the JavaScript view.

Notice that a single line of code has been added at line 2 - this is the equivalent of the ``||player: say ":)" ||`` block.

Again as this block came from the ``||player: Player||`` drawer the code starts with the word player.

We want to make the player perform an action (say a word) so we call a function of the player called say.

The say function takes a parameter (what to say) - this is the portion inside the brackets and as what we want to say is text it is enclosed in double quotes (" ").

## Step 9 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the Convert code to Blocks button.

Add a ``||player: teleport to ~0 ~0 ~0 ||`` block from the ``||player: Player||`` drawer into the event handler and change the Y coordinate to 10.

## Step 10 @unplugged
Change back to the JavaScript view.

Notice that a single line of code has been added at line 3 - this is the equivalent of the ``||player: teleport to ~0 ~0 ~0 ||`` block.

Again the teleport block came from the player drawer so the code starts with the word player and we want the player to be teleported therefore the teleport function is called.

This function takes a parameter - where to be teleported to. This parameter is a coordinate.

## Step 11 @unplugged
While in JavaScript view you can choose to either enter text into the editor window or drag blocks of JavaScript from the drawers like you did with MakeCode blocks.

## Step 12 @unplugged
Add a new empty line to your code after line by placing your cursor at the end of that line and pressing the Enter key.
```javascript 
player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
```

## Step 13 @unplugged
Enter the JavaScript code 
```javascript 
player.say("This is my first line of JavaScript!")
```
on the new line.

## Step 14 @unplugged
Switch back to the MakeCode block view and notice there is now a ``||player: say "This is my first line of JavaScript!" ||`` block.

![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.1.1/images/12.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

Switch back to JavaScript.

![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.1.1/images/11.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

## Step 15 @unplugged
Create another empty line after the code. 
```javascript 
player.say("This is my first line of JavaScript!")
```
you just entered.

Open the ``||player: Player ||`` drawer and notice there are a number of blocks just like in MakeCode blocks view.

Find the block ``||player: say ":)" ||`` and drag it out and place it on the recently created empty line in your code.

You should notice the code
```javascript 
player.say(":)")
```
has been added.

It can be tricky to position the JavaScript block easily so its best to just type JavaScript text into the editor.

## Step 16 @tutorialCompleted
Close Code Builder and go back to the NPC.  Download the activity first by clicking the Download button then load the new MakeCode page by clicking Blank Page. 

Once you have completed the activity move onto the next Non-Player Character.
